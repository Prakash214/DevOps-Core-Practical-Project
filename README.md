 create a service-orientated architecture for your application, this application must be composed of at least 4 services that work together.

Service #1
The core service – this will render the Jinja2 templates and need to interact with your application, it will also be responsible for communicating with the other 3 services, and finally for persisting some data in an SQL database.

Service #2 + #3
These will both generate a random “Object”, this object can be whatever you like as we encourage creativity in this project.

Service #4
This service will also create an “Object” however this “Object” must be based upon the results of service #2 + #3 using some pre-defined rules.
